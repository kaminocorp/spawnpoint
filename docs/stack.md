# Corellia — Implementation Stack (v1)

Concrete engineering picks for v1. Companion docs:

- `vision.md` — the product vision
- `blueprint.md` — *what* we're building and the architecture rules (esp. §11)
- `stack.md` (this doc) — *how* we're building it: tools, layout, pipelines,
  deploy. The "why these picks" reference.
- `archive/backend-scaffolding.md` — historical step-by-step recipe for
  creating `backend/`, with starter file contents (archival; live code is
  now authoritative)
- `frontend-scaffolding.md` — step-by-step recipe for creating `frontend/`,
  with starter file contents

When picks change, update this document. Blueprint rules (especially §11)
still win when any rule in this doc conflicts with them. The scaffolding
docs are recipes; once scaffolding is complete, the live code is
authoritative.

## 1. Stack summary

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Frontend framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript | RSC streaming for fleet view; pure FE role (no Server Actions doing business logic) |
| Frontend styling | Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Form-heavy admin UI; shadcn + react-hook-form + zod for §10 flow |
| Frontend auth client | `@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr` | Cookie-based SSR sessions; native to Next.js App Router |
| API contract | Protobuf + Connect-go (Buf toolchain) | Single `.proto`, generates Go server + TS client; HTTP/1.1 wire format |
| Backend language | Go 1.22+ | Idiomatic fit for an orchestrator: goroutines for "spawn N agents" fan-out, strong typing, single static binary |
| Backend router | Chi | Stdlib-shaped, minimal magic; mounts Connect-go handlers as `http.Handler` |
| Backend ORM | sqlc | Write SQL, get typed Go — no runtime query-builder surprises |

### Layout rules

1. **No cross-contamination.** `frontend/` never imports from `backend/` or
   vice versa. The *only* shared surface is code generated from
   `shared/proto/` into `frontend/src/gen/` and `backend/internal/gen/`.
2. **`shared/` is contract-only, no source code.** Proto IDL, OpenAPI
   specs, JSON Schema, and similar language-neutral contracts live here.
   Never Go, never TS, never any language-specific implementation code. If
   you feel the urge to add `shared/utils/` or `shared/types/`, stop —
   that code belongs in `frontend/` or `backend/` (or, if truly shared,
   needs a rethink about what "shared" means).
3. **Generated code is committed.** Both `frontend/src/gen/` and
   `backend/internal/gen/` are checked in. This keeps builds reproducible
   without requiring every environment to run codegen.
4. **Generated code is never hand-edited.** Anyone editing it is treated
   the same as editing `node_modules`: the change will be blown away by the
   next `buf generate` and the diff should be rejected in review.

---

## 3. API contract: Proto + Connect-go

### Why Connect-go (not gRPC, not OpenAPI)

- **Single source of truth.** The `.proto` file defines service, methods,
  request shapes, and response shapes in one place. Both halves of the
  stack import from it.
- **HTTP/1.1 wire format.** Connect speaks plain HTTP/1.1 with JSON or
  Protobuf bodies. No gRPC ingress, no HTTP/2 requirement, `curl`-able in
  a terminal.
- **First-class TS and Go codegen.** The Buf ecosystem generates idiomatic
  clients for both — no OpenAPI-style "close enough" translation.
- **Streaming ready.** Unary-only for v1, but server-streaming is free if
  v2 needs "tail agent logs" over a single long-lived call.

### Where .proto files live

Authored in `shared/proto/corellia/v1/`. Placed under the root `shared/`
folder (not `backend/proto/`) to signal that Proto is a **language-neutral
contract between the two halves**, not a backend-owned artifact. The `v1`
package namespace is permanent — breaking changes go to `v2`, never
silent edits to `v1`.

### Codegen pipeline

Driven by `buf.gen.yaml` in `shared/proto/`. Emits:

- `backend/internal/gen/` — Go server interfaces and types
- `frontend/src/gen/` — TS client + message classes

Trigger:

```bash
# from repo root
pnpm proto:generate     # wraps `buf generate shared/proto`
```

A `buf generate` runs in CI on every PR; drift between `.proto` changes
and committed generated code fails the build.

### File organization convention

- One `.proto` file per domain area: `agents.proto`, `adapters.proto`,
  `deploy.proto`, `auth.proto`.
- One service per file. Messages used only by that service also live in
  that file; messages shared across services live in `shared.proto`.

---

## 4. Frontend / Backend contract boundary

The two halves communicate exclusively through Connect-go RPCs. No direct
SQL from FE, no Supabase REST calls from FE for application data (only for
auth). This keeps the BE as the single enforcement point for application
logic.

Supabase client on FE is used strictly for:

- Sign-in / sign-up / password reset / session management
- Reading the current session to obtain the access token

Every RPC call attaches the Supabase access token as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The Go middleware validates and loads the
corresponding user from `public.users`.

---

## 5. Auth flow (Supabase ↔ Go)

### Sign-in (frontend)

1. User enters credentials in the Supabase Auth UI (or a custom form).
2. `@supabase/supabase-js` issues the sign-in call, receives a session
   (access token JWT + refresh token).
3. `@supabase/ssr` persists the session as an HTTP-only cookie so SSR
   renders can read it.
4. All subsequent RPC calls read the access token from the Supabase client
   and attach it as a Bearer header.

### Request validation (backend)

1. Chi middleware reads `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
2. Parses the JWT and resolves the public key for the token's `kid`
   via the JWKS cache (fetched once from
   `$SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` at backend boot,
   refreshed hourly in the background; unknown `kid`s trigger an
   immediate rate-limited refetch).
3. Validates the signature with ES256 (ECDSA / P-256) and rejects
   any other algorithm via `jwt.WithValidMethods` — defence against
   algorithm-confusion attacks. Extracts `sub` (Supabase auth user
   UUID) and `email`.
4. Attaches an `AuthClaims{AuthUserID, Email}` value to the request
   context.
5. Domain services (e.g. `users.Service`) load the corresponding
   `public.users` row by `auth_user_id` on demand, auto-provisioning
   it on first login. Loading/provisioning is a domain concern, not a
   transport concern — the middleware stays thin and has no DB
   dependency.

### JWT validation is offline (after boot)

The JWKS document is fetched once at backend boot and cached in
memory; all subsequent request-path validation is fully offline
(ECDSA verify against the cached public key). The cache refreshes
in the background every hour and immediately on any unknown `kid`
(rate-limited to one refetch per 5 minutes) — so Supabase-side key
rotations propagate within the cache TTL without a backend restart.
Token expiry is enforced (default: 1 hour); refresh happens on the
FE via `@supabase/supabase-js`.

---

## 6. Data model ↔ Supabase

Blueprint §9 defines the schema. Implementation specifics:

- All Corellia tables live in Postgres' default `public` schema.
- `public.users` holds a FK `auth_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`.
  The Supabase `auth` schema is read-only from application code.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) is disabled in v1.** Go BE has full DB
  access via the connection string; authorization is enforced in
  application code in `backend/internal/agents/` etc.
- Migrations live in `backend/migrations/` and are run by `goose`
  against `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT`, which keeps the `postgres` superuser
  role (required for DDL on Supabase's `auth` schema triggers):
  ```bash
  goose -dir backend/migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL_DIRECT" up
  ```
  Committed SQL files; no Supabase CLI dependency. The app runtime
  uses `DATABASE_URL` separately — see §8 for why *both* URLs point
  at the same Direct Connection host, with the split being role and
  lifecycle rather than pooler-vs-not.
- sqlc reads from `backend/queries/*.sql` + `backend/sqlc.yaml` and emits
  typed Go query functions into `backend/internal/db/`.

---

## 7. Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node 20+ via [Volta](https://volta.sh) or nvm
- pnpm 9+
- Go 1.22+
- [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air): `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`
- [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose): `go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest`
- [overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind): `brew install overmind`
- [buf](https://buf.build): `brew install bufbuild/buf/buf`
- [direnv](https://direnv.net): `brew install direnv` + `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` in `~/.zshrc`
- A Supabase project (dev) with credentials populated in `backend/.env` + `frontend/.env.local`

### First-time setup

```bash
pnpm install                                 # installs frontend deps
go work sync                                 # syncs Go workspace
pnpm proto:generate                          # emits generated Go + TS
goose -dir backend/migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL_DIRECT" up
```

### Running locally

```bash
overmind start                               # boots both halves with hot reload
# — or individually —
pnpm -C frontend dev                         # Next.js on :3000
cd backend && air                            # Go API on :8080
```

Both processes read `.env` (repo-root, gitignored). `.env.example` is the
committed template.

---

## 8. Environment variables

Per-app env files: `backend/.env` (auto-loaded by Go via `godotenv/autoload`
from the binary's cwd) and `frontend/.env.local` (auto-loaded by Next.js from
the `frontend/` project root). Both gitignored. `.env.example` at repo root is
the single committed template documenting every var both halves read.
Validated on startup — Go config package panics on missing required vars;
Next.js fails the build.

Shell-level loading via `direnv` (recommended). Committed `backend/.envrc`
and `frontend/.envrc` contain `dotenv .env` and `dotenv .env.local`
respectively; direnv auto-sources the matching file into the shell on `cd`,
unloading on `cd` out. This makes `goose`, ad-hoc `go test`, and any other
in-directory CLI tool see the same env vars as the Go binary. First-time
setup: `brew install direnv`, add `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` to `~/.zshrc`,
then `direnv allow` in `backend/` and `frontend/` once (re-required whenever
an `.envrc` file's contents change, which is the security gate that keeps
committed `.envrc` files safe). Fallback without direnv: `set -a; source
backend/.env; set +a` before every goose invocation.

Shared Supabase values are duplicated across the two files by design: the
backend reads `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, the frontend reads
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Values must
match. `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` lives in `backend/.env` but is shell-sourced
for `goose` — it is never read by `config.Load()`.

### Database URLs — both Direct Connection, split by role

Both `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` point at Supabase's **Direct
Connection** endpoint (`db.<project-ref>.supabase.co:5432`). The split is
role-and-lifecycle, not host: `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` stays on the
superuser `postgres` role and is shell-sourced by `goose` for DDL;
`DATABASE_URL` will later downgrade to a restricted `corellia_app` role
read by the Go binary at runtime.

**Why no external pooler on the wire.** `pgxpool` acts as an in-process
transaction pooler — each query leases a backend for its own duration
and releases it (a `BeginTx` block leases for the transaction's
duration). Thousands of concurrent goroutines multiplex onto a bounded
pool (`MaxConns=10`), so Postgres backend count scales with *Go
instance count*, not user count. Adding Supavisor in transaction mode
(`:6543`) would stack a redundant multiplexer across a network hop
*and* break pgx's prepared-statement cache (which sqlc relies on).
Supavisor in session mode (`*.pooler.supabase.com:5432`) is the
**IPv4 fallback** for local-dev networks without IPv6 reachability to
the Direct host — swapping `DATABASE_URL` to the Session Pooler form
is a config change with no code impact, and per-developer variation
costs nothing since `.env` is gitignored. The jump from Direct to
Session Pooler as the *primary* runtime URL becomes worth making when
horizontal-scaling operational concerns appear (connection storms on
rolling deploys, centralized connection limits across ≥10 backend
instances), not before. **Never transaction pooling.**

| Var | Consumer | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | backend | App connection — Supabase **Direct Connection** (`db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432`, IPv6). `pgxpool` multiplexes in-process; no external pooler. Session Pooler (`*.pooler.supabase.com:5432`) is the IPv4 fallback. |
| `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` | shell only | Migration-only Direct Connection (same host, `postgres` superuser role); read by `goose`, never by the Go binary. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | both | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | frontend | Public anon key, safe for client bundle |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | backend (rare) | Service-role key for admin ops; avoid if possible |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN` | backend | Calls Fly's GraphQL API to spawn apps/machines |
| `FLY_ORG_SLUG` | backend | Fly organization to create apps under |
| `PORT` | backend | HTTP listen port (default 8080) |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | backend | Allowed CORS origin for the deployed FE (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | frontend | BE base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) |

---

## 9. Build pipelines

### Codegen (must run before build on any proto change)

```bash
pnpm proto:generate     # wraps `buf generate` for both FE and BE
pnpm sqlc:generate      # regenerates sqlc Go code from queries/*.sql
```

### Frontend build

```bash
pnpm -C frontend build
```

Produces `.next/` output. Deployed by Vercel automatically on push.

### Backend build

```bash
cd backend && go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api
```

Fly's Dockerfile runs this inside a multi-stage build and produces a
static binary.

### CI checks (per PR)

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm proto:generate` + `pnpm sqlc:generate` + `git diff --exit-code`
  (fails if generated code is stale)
- `pnpm -C frontend type-check`
- `pnpm -C frontend lint`
- `cd backend && go vet ./... && go test ./...`
- `cd backend && go build ./...`

---

## 10. Deploy

### Frontend (Vercel)

- Connect GitHub repo, set project root to `frontend/`.
- Env vars configured in Vercel dashboard.
- Auto-deploys `main`; preview URLs per PR.

### Backend (Fly.io)

- App name: `corellia-api`.
- Config lives in `backend/fly.toml`.
- Deploy:
  ```bash
  cd backend && fly deploy
  ```
- Secrets stored as Fly app secrets (`fly secrets set KEY=VALUE`), never
  in `fly.toml` or git.

### Agent Fly apps (spawned by Corellia itself)

These are separate Fly apps, one per `AgentInstance`, created
programmatically by `FlyDeployTarget`. Naming:
`corellia-agent-<instance-uuid>`. Lifecycle is fully owned by Corellia.

---

## 11. Architecture rules — implementation additions

Extends blueprint §11. Same blocking-rule status.

6. **No Supabase-specific code outside `backend/internal/auth/` and
   `backend/internal/db/`.** Domain code sees `User` structs and repository
   interfaces, not raw Supabase clients or JWT internals.
7. **Generated code (`*/gen/`) is committed but never hand-edited.**
   Treat as read-only. Drift is caught in CI.
8. **All env vars read through `backend/internal/config/`.** The config
   package is the single place that reads `os.Getenv`; it validates at
   startup and panics on missing required vars. Domain code receives a
   typed `Config` struct.
9. **Business logic never lives in Connect handlers.** Handlers in
   `backend/internal/httpsrv/` (or wherever the handler glue lives) parse
   the RPC request, call into domain packages (`agents`, `deploy`, etc.),
   and marshal the response. Handlers should be <30 lines each.
10. **Frontend never reaches into Supabase for application data.**
    Application data flows through Connect-go RPCs exclusively. Supabase
    client is for auth (sign-in, session) only.

---

## 12. Hour-zero scaffolding order

The "prove the pipeline works before writing product code" milestone.

1. **Hour 0–1.** Monorepo skeleton: `frontend/` scaffolded via
   `create-next-app`, `backend/` with `go mod init`, `shared/proto/`
   with first `.proto` file, `Procfile`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`.
2. **Hour 1–2.** Supabase project created. First migration applied
   (users + organizations + agent_templates + agent_instances from
   blueprint §9). sqlc emits typed queries.
3. **Hour 2–3.** Auth end-to-end: Next.js sign-in page (Supabase), Go
   middleware validates JWT and loads user.
4. **Hour 3–4.** First Connect-go RPC: `GetCurrentUser`. FE calls it
   with the session token, BE returns the user row, FE renders the
   email.
5. **Hour 4–5.** Both halves deployed. FE on Vercel with preview URL,
   BE on Fly with its own URL. CORS configured, end-to-end works in
   production.
6. **Hour 5+.** Start product code — `HarnessAdapter`, `AgentTemplate`,
   `FlyDeployTarget.spawn()`, the RPG character-creation flow, fleet
   view.

If we hit end of hour 5 with "deployed, signed-in, RPC working," the
hackathon is already in a winning position. If we're behind at hour 8,
we triage scope — never plumbing.

---

## 13. Known deferrals (implementation-specific)

Things deliberately left out of v1 beyond blueprint §13:

- No shared UI package between apps (frontend owns its components).
- No GitHub Actions or Turbo remote caching in v1 — ship without CI
  if necessary.
- No end-to-end tests (Playwright) in v1 — Go unit tests on domain
  packages only.
- No observability stack beyond Fly's native logs.
- No feature flagging.
- No internationalization.
- No dark mode beyond whatever shadcn gives us for free.
