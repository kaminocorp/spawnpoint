# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

Corellia is a control plane for AI agents — spawn, deploy, govern, and manage agents across any model, provider, or harness framework. v1 is a hackathon-scoped MVP: one harness (Hermes), one deploy target (Fly.io), Supabase auth, Go backend + Next.js frontend.

**Live code is authoritative.** When any doc under `docs/` (architecture, scaffolding recipes, prior plans) conflicts with what's in the codebase, the codebase wins. `docs/changelog.md` is the moving record of what's shipped and why; this file stays still.

## Doc hierarchy (read these when context is needed)

Precedence — the higher doc wins on conflict:

1. `docs/blueprint.md` — product architecture, data model (§9), **architecture rules (§11)**, MVP scope (§1)
2. `docs/stack.md` — tech picks with rationale, monorepo layout (§2), **implementation rules (§11)**, env vars (§8)
3. `docs/vision.md` — product framing (admin/policy-setter model, "garage of harnesses")

Scaffolding recipes under `docs/archive/` are historical reference for how the codebase came to be — useful when reconstructing intent, never load-bearing for current behavior. `docs/changelog.md` is the diff-log between what the docs say and what the code does at any given milestone.

### Backend layout (`backend/internal/`)

- `auth/` — Supabase JWT middleware (ES256, offline validation via cached JWKS from Supabase's well-known endpoint; initial fetch at boot, background hourly refresh, unknown-`kid` refetch rate-limited to one per 5 min). Attaches `AuthClaims{AuthUserID, Email}` to request context. No DB access here — user provisioning is a domain concern.
- `config/` — env var loading via `caarlos0/env`. The **only** place that touches `os.Getenv`. Panics on missing required vars at startup.
- `db/` — sqlc-generated types + queries. `pool.go` is the only hand-written file here; everything else is generated from `migrations/` + `queries/`.
- `gen/corellia/v1/` — buf-generated Go from `shared/proto/`. Never hand-edit.
- `httpsrv/` — Chi router, CORS, auth middleware wiring, Connect handler mounts. Handlers are thin (<30 lines); they parse → call domain → marshal response. Handler tests use small in-package interfaces (`agentsService`, `userIdentityLookup`) so the service can be faked without a DB.
- `deploy/` — `DeployTarget` interface plus its concrete implementations and the `Resolver` indirection that hands one to a caller. The **only** package that imports infrastructure-provider SDKs (per architecture rule §11.1). Deferred targets exist as `NotImplemented` stubs (rule §11.4).
- Domain packages (e.g. `users/`, `organizations/`, `agents/`, `adapters/`) — each owns its business logic, exposes a `Service` consumed by `httpsrv/`, defines its own sentinel errors, and accepts narrow private interfaces (e.g. `agentQueries`, `Transactor`) so tests fake without touching `db.Queries` directly. New domains land here as new sub-packages.

### The contract boundary

Frontend and backend communicate **exclusively via Connect-go RPCs** over HTTP/1.1. Proto files in `shared/proto/corellia/v1/` are the single source of truth; `buf generate` emits Go (`backend/internal/gen/`) and TS (`frontend/src/gen/`, eventually) simultaneously. **Both generated trees are committed** and CI fails on drift.

Frontend uses Supabase client **only for auth** (sign-in, session). All application data flows through Connect RPCs. No direct SQL, no Supabase REST for app data. See stack.md §4 and rule §11.10.

### Database connection — two URLs, both Direct Connection

Both `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` point at Supabase's **Direct Connection** host (`db.<project-ref>.supabase.co:5432`, IPv6). The split is *role and lifecycle*, not host:

- `DATABASE_URL` — app runtime, read by `config.Load()` at boot, consumed by `pgxpool`. Will later downgrade to a restricted `corellia_app` role (non-RLS-bypassing).
- `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` — migration-only, shell-sourced by `goose`. Stays on the `postgres` superuser role (needed for DDL on Supabase's `auth` schema triggers). Deliberately **not in `config.Config`** so the Go binary never holds superuser credentials.

**Why Direct, not an external pooler.** `pgxpool` is an in-process transaction pooler: each `db.QueryContext` call leases a backend for the query's duration only and returns it immediately; a `BeginTx` block leases for the transaction's duration. A single Go process serves thousands of concurrent HTTP goroutines off a bounded pool (`MaxConns=10`), so Postgres backend count scales with *Go instance count*, not user count. An external transaction pooler (Supavisor `:6543`) would stack a redundant multiplexer across a network hop *and* break pgx's prepared-statement cache (which sqlc relies on). **Never transaction pooling.** The Session Pooler (`*.pooler.supabase.com:5432`) is the **IPv4 fallback** only — swap `DATABASE_URL` for the Session Pooler form if your local network can't reach the Direct host over IPv6; drop-in compatible, no code change.

**Ceiling math.** Postgres caps concurrent backends at ~500 on managed instances. With `pgxpool.MaxConns=10`, we exhaust that only at ~50 Go backend instances — well past any v1/v2 scale. The eventual jump from Direct to Supavisor **session** mode (not transaction mode) happens when horizontal-scaling operational concerns bite (connection storms on rolling deploys, centralized limits across many instances), not before.

## Architecture rules (blocking — treated as defects if broken)

From `blueprint.md` §11 and `stack.md` §11. The non-obvious ones:

1. **No Fly-specific code outside `internal/deploy/FlyDeployTarget`.** Everything else sees only the `DeployTarget` interface.
2. **AgentTemplates pin by Docker image digest, never by mutable tag.** Governance primitive — no exceptions.
3. **Harness configuration flows through `CORELLIA_*` env vars.** Adapters translate these to harness-native names; Corellia code never reaches into a harness's native env var names.
4. **Deferred features are stubbed as real interface implementations, not fake UI buttons.** A `DeployTarget` returning `NotImplemented` is acceptable; a non-functional button is not.
5. **No forking of upstream harnesses.** Capabilities are added via adapter wrappers or sidecars.
6. **No Supabase specifics outside `internal/auth/` and `internal/db/`.**
7. **Generated code (`internal/gen/`, `internal/db/` — every file except `db/pool.go`) is never hand-edited.** Treat it like `node_modules`.
8. **All env vars read through `internal/config/`.** Config validates and panics at startup; domain code receives a typed `Config` struct.
9. **Business logic never in Connect handlers.** Handlers stay <30 lines — parse, call domain, marshal.
10. **Frontend never reaches Supabase for application data** — RPCs only.
11. **Deploy-target credentials never live in Corellia's database.** Raw credentials live in a secret store; DB rows reference them via opaque `storage_ref`. When v1.5 introduces user-supplied targets, acquisition uses the provider's narrowest-capability mechanism (Fly OAuth → org-scoped macaroon, AWS STS → assumed role, etc.). **Never accept PATs from users.** Paste-as-fallback only where no narrower mechanism exists, with capability scope labelled in the UI.

## Common commands

Run from the indicated directory.

### Codegen (run after changing proto or SQL)

```bash
# Proto → Go + TS (from repo root; script wraps `buf generate shared/proto`)
pnpm proto:generate

# SQL → Go (from backend/)
sqlc generate
```

Both generated trees are committed. CI runs generation and diffs against HEAD.

### Migrations (always via DATABASE_URL_DIRECT)

```bash
# Run from backend/ — direnv auto-loads DATABASE_URL_DIRECT from backend/.env on cd
goose -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL_DIRECT" up
goose -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL_DIRECT" down
goose -dir migrations create <name> sql
```

### Running locally

```bash
# Backend with hot reload (from backend/). Auto-loads .env via godotenv/autoload.
air

# Or plain build/run
cd backend && go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api && ./bin/api

# From repo root — boots FE + BE together with hot reload:
overmind start                # reads Procfile
```

### Testing + checks

```bash
cd backend && go vet ./...
cd backend && go test ./...                   # all packages
cd backend && go test ./internal/agents -run TestSpawn   # single test

pnpm -C frontend type-check
pnpm -C frontend lint
pnpm -C frontend build
```

## Testing conventions

- Table-driven unit tests for `internal/*` packages with branching logic; colocated `<file>_test.go`.
- **No DB mocks.** sqlc generates thin SQL wrappers — mocking them tests nothing. Use real Postgres via testcontainers-go or a local dev DB.
- No Playwright / E2E in v1. The deployed RPC round-trip is the integration smoke test.

## Environment

Per-app env files, both gitignored: `backend/.env` (backend vars; auto-loaded by `godotenv/autoload` from the Go binary's cwd) and `frontend/.env.local` (frontend vars; auto-loaded by Next.js from the `frontend/` project root). `.env.example` at repo root is the single committed template documenting every var both halves read. **Recommended local setup: install `direnv` (`brew install direnv` + `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` in `~/.zshrc`) and `direnv allow` in `backend/` and `frontend/` once.** The committed `backend/.envrc` and `frontend/.envrc` auto-load the appropriate env file into your shell on `cd`, so `goose`, `go test`, and any other in-directory CLI tool sees the same env as the Go binary. Without direnv, `goose` migrations require manual sourcing: `set -a; source backend/.env; set +a`. Required backend vars (panic-on-missing): `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `FLY_SPAWN_TOKEN`, `FLY_ORG_SLUG`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`. **`FLY_SPAWN_TOKEN` is deliberately not named `FLY_API_TOKEN`** — `flyctl` honors `FLY_API_TOKEN` ahead of `fly auth login` credentials, and direnv-loading the runtime spawn token under that name silently shadows the operator's interactive deploy identity. The rename keeps the two roles in their own lanes (see changelog 0.7.6). The JWKS URL for JWT validation is derived from `SUPABASE_URL` — no separate secret needed. `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` lives in `backend/.env` but is shell-sourced for `goose`, never read by `config.Load()`. Shared Supabase values (`SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ↔ their `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` twins) are duplicated across the two files by design; values must match.
